        </div> -->
        <p class="sectionsubtag2 text-sm"><strong>1. The First PC:</strong></p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag2 text-sm">
          The world's first personal computer, the "Kenbak-1," was introduced in
          1971. It was powered by a series of switches and had only 256 bytes of
          memory. Compared to today's PCs, it was extremely limited in terms of
          functionality and computing power.
        </p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag2 text-sm"><strong>2. The IBM PC:</strong></p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag2 text-sm">
          In 1981, IBM launched the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC). It quickly
          became the standard for personal computing, and its open architecture
          allowed for hardware and software compatibility, leading to the rapid
          growth of the PC industry.
        </p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag2 text-sm"><strong>3. Moore's Law:</strong></p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag2 text-sm">
          Moore's Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, states that
          the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every
          two years. This observation has held true for several decades and has
          been a driving force behind the advancement of PC technology.
        </p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag2 text-sm">

        </p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag2 text-sm">
          Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) revolutionized the PC industry. The
          introduction of iconic operating systems like Windows and Macintosh
          made PCs more accessible to non-technical users by replacing
          command-line interfaces with intuitive graphical interfaces.
        </p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag2 text-sm">
          <strong>5. The QWERTY Keyboard:</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag2 text-sm">
          The QWERTY keyboard layout, which is still used on most PCs, was
          designed in the 1860s by Christopher Sholes. It was originally created
          to prevent mechanical typewriters from jamming by placing commonly
          used letters apart from each other.
        </p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag2 text-sm"><strong>6. The Mouse:</strong></p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag2 text-sm">
          The first computer mouse was invented in 1964 by Douglas Engelbart.
          Initially, it was made of wood and had two wheels perpendicular to
          each other. The mouse became an essential input device for PCs,
          enabling users to interact with graphical interfaces more intuitively.
        </p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag2 text-sm">
          <strong>7. The World Wide Web:</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag2 text-sm">
          The invention of the World Wide Web by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989
          transformed the PC into a gateway to a global network of information
          and communication. It revolutionized how we access and share
          knowledge, paving the way for the digital age we live in today.
        </p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag2 text-sm"><strong>8. Gaming PCs:</strong></p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag2 text-sm">
          Gaming PCs are specifically designed to handle resource-intensive
